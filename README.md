# Rewired IMGUI Blocker

Simple BepInEx Plugin to block Rewired keyboard input when a Unity IMGUI textfield is focused.

Will fail gracefully and do nothing when Rewired is not actually loaded.

To install, you need [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) version 5 installed for the game. Then just download the latest [RewiredIMGUIBlocker.dll](https://github.com/benediktwerner/RewiredBlocker/releases/download/v1.0.0/RewiredIMGUIBlocker.dll) from the releases section and put it in `BepInEx/plugins` in the games directory.
